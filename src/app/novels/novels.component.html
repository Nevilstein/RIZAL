            <h4>Noli Me Tangere</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Noli Me Tángere (Latin for Touch me not) is a novel written by José Rizal, one of the national heroes of the Philippines, during the colonization of the country by Spain to describe perceived inequities of the Spanish Catholic priests and the ruling government.</p><hr>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Originally written in Spanish, the book is more commonly published and read in the Philippines in either Tagalog or English. Together with its sequel, El Filibusterismo, the reading of Noli is obligatory for high school students throughout the country. The two novels are widely considered as the national epic of the Philippines and are performed in non-musical operas throughout the country.</p>

            <h4>El Filibusterismo</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">El filibusterismo, also known by its English alternative title The Reign of Greed, is the second novel written by Philippine national hero José Rizal. It is the sequel to Noli me tangere and, like the first book, was written in Spanish. It was first published in 1891 in Ghent.</p><hr>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The novel centers on the Noli-El fili duology's main character Crisostomo Ibarra, now returning for vengeance as "Simoun". El fili's dark theme departs dramatically from the previous novel's hopeful and romantic atmosphere, signifying Ibarra's resort to solving his country's issues through violent means, after his previous attempt at reforming the country's system have made no effect and seemed impossible with the corrupt attitude of the Spaniards towards the Filipinos.</p>
